      <h3>Explain how well the needs of the envisaged end user are met:</h3>
      <p>
        The system meets the needs of an end-user of a person with physical disabilities as it is operated automatically. 
        For persons with intellectual disabilities/older persons with cognitive decline the system functions without the need to read temperatures/understand 
        thermostat regulation but reduces their risk of hyperthermia in heatwaves/hypothermia during winter. 
        Data is recorded and personal accounts can be created. As it operates when necessary only, it is energy/cost efficient for users. 
      </p>

      <h3>
        Describe with justification how well your artefact could be modified/improved:
      </h3>
      <p>
        These systems can be linked to Alexa/other IoT based devices.
         Alerting/alarming systems can be added to inform users that temperatures limits are exceeded,
          these can be changed depending on user’s preference. <br />
        <br />
        The website can be converted into a mobile app with further control/regulatory functions. Wearable technologies (Fitbits) that detect biological temperatures could be programmed to activate the external embedded system, cooling/heating the person based on their temperature.
         These would be beneficial for patients experiencing high temperature in hospitals isolation wards.

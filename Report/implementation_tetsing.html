      <h1>3. Implementation & Testing: </h1>
      <h3>Project Timeline: </h3>
      <p>The project was managed from start to finish using the project life cycle below, start & end dates were specified.</p>
        <img src="img/timeLine.png">
      <h3>Investigation Stage:</h3>
      <p>I captured the details of the user’s requirements to understand the scope of the project and how it could be achieved.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/invastigation.png">
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Plan stage</h3>
      <p>I outlined the timeline and milestones necessary to complete the project.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/plan.png">
      <h3>Design Stage</h3>
      <p>I translated the actual requirements into technical architect designs, in which I defined the components, programming language, tools, and APIs.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/designStage.png">
      <h3>Create Stage:</h3>
      <p>I focused on writing the actual program and developing the website and database.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/createStage.png">
      <h3>Evaluation Stage:</h3>
      <p>I tested various programs and components to ensure that they worked.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/evaluate.png">
      <h3>Document Stage: </h3>
      <p>The main focus was to complete the documentation and to create a zip file containing two subfolders labelled Artefact & Report.</p>
      <img style="width: 900px; height: auto;" src="img/document.png">

      <table>
        <tr>
        <td><h4>Problem 1:</h4>On the Windows computer, the Micro:bit  was connecting as a drive called MAINTENANCE instead of MICROBIT and was causing an issue downloading the codes.
           I downloaded and updated the Micro:bit  firmware with Micro:bit  V2. Once, updated the Micro:bit  worked and I was able to download the codes.

        <tr>
          <td><h4>Problem 2:</h4>         
            COM 3 port was not opening, which was required to communicate within the Micro:bit  programme. During debugging, I discovered that the other software on the computer was using the COM 3 port.
             Once the software was disabled/closed, the connection was established with the Database and Micro:bit.

          1: Created a database within the Firebase to check the status of the devices based on the value On/Off.<br>
          2: Clicked On/Off button on the Web page, the script sent data to the Firebase.<br>
          3: Whenever the value was turned On/Off the web page updated the database.<br>
          4: The Python script on our Micro:bit read the data and turned the Micro:bit device On/Off as per the value stored within the Firebase database.<br>
          5: The web page updated the Firebase database, while the Python script coded within the Micro:bit read the values and controlled the device based on the value. (On/Off)<br>

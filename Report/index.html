        <h1>1. Investigation & Plan:</h1>
        <p>Smart homes incorporate automation systems to provide residents with increased convenience, security, energy efficiency and solutions to climate control. Networked 
          devices connect directly/indirectly via a gateway to the internet in order to control/regulate household functions. In 2021, the smart home penetration rate worldwide
           was at 12.2%, the number of smart homes worldwide was >258 million and the forecast smart home market worldwide was at 99.41 bn USD [1].

              CO2 emissions worldwide increased from 6 billion to over 34 billion tonnes between 1950 & 2020 [3]. 
              <p>NASA statistics reveal that from 1800-2021 global surface temperatures increased significantly (-0.1 to 0.8°C). 2021 had the 6th highest temperature on record (NOAA, 2021) due to global warming [4]. </p>
              <p>In British Columbia, in 2021, 595 deaths occurred related to temperatures > 40 °C (‘heat-dome’), 70% of the dead were aged >70  years and 99% overheated inside a home/hotel [5]. </p>
              <pbr>In Ireland 1983-2013, 294 deaths were caused by seven heatwaves [6].<p>
              The elderly/disabled are at increased risk during heatwaves [7]. Hyperthermia, is a thermoregulatory disorder where core temperature increases > 40.5°C is a medical emergency. Early recognition of heat increases (externally/internally) is required to reduce the thermal risk [8].

          <h3>Social Implications: </h3>
          <p>Social Implications of the embedded home automation system will include increased independence for users, reduction of their risk of hyperthermia indoors during 
            heatwaves providing reassurance and reductions in energy costs/consumption. It will contribute to The National Housing Strategy for
             Disabled People’s 2022-2027 [13] aim to increase the provision of accessible homes/information/technology to promote people’s participation
             in their communities and assist in the practical implementation of legislated guidelines from The United Nations Convention on the Rights 
             of Persons with Disabilities (2015)/The National Positive Ageing Strategy (2015) [14,15]. Dependency on the internet,
              privacy interference and the expense of implementation/maintenance creating disparities in uptake are some ethical concerns. The website will make the products accessible.
